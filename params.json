{"name":"Angular UI Tour","tagline":"Product tour using Angular UI Bootstrap Tooltips","body":"## About\r\n\r\nThis repo is a work in progress to replace [Angular Bootstrap Tour](http://github.com/benmarch/angular-bootstrap-tour).\r\nThe main difference between this plugin and the previous is that this does not depend on jQuery. The previous plugin was\r\nsimply an AngularJS wrapper around [Bootstrap Tour](http://www.bootstraptour.com) which was written for Twitter Bootstrap,\r\nwhich depends on jQuery. Instead, this plugin uses Angular UI Bootstrap and its fantastic Tooltip plugin. I have kept some\r\nof the API the same as Angular Bootstrap Tour, but because this uses Tooltips and does not use Bootstrap Tour, it made\r\nsense to change a few things. Please note that this is in the very early stages of development, and the API is subject to change.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nGet the package:\r\n\r\n    bower install angular-ui-tour\r\n\r\nAdd the script tags:\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"bower_components/angular-bootstrap/ui-bootstrap-tpls.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"bower_components/angular-ui-tour/dist/angular-ui-tour.js\"></script>\r\n\r\nThen add the module to your app:\r\n\r\n    angular.module('myApp', ['bm.uiTour']);\r\n    \r\n## Tour Configuration\r\n\r\nTours can be configured either programatically in a config block, or declaratively as part of the uiTour directive declaration.\r\n\r\nTo configure in a config block, use TourConfigProvider.set(optionName, optionValue);\r\n\r\nTo configure on a tour declaration, use `ui-tour-<option-name>=\"optionValue\"`\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n|      Name       |   Type   | Default Value             |                     Description                                                                                                                 |\r\n| --------------  | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| placement       | string   | \"top\"                     | Where the popup should display relative to the element.                                                                                         |\r\n| animation       | boolean  | true                      | Should the popup fade in/out.                                                                                                                   |\r\n| popupDelay      | number   | 1                         | Time to delay (in ms) between when the popup is requested to show and when it is shown. **Note** must be positive for multi-page tours to work. |\r\n| closePopupDelay | number   | 0                         | Time to delay (in ms) between when the popup is requested to hide and when it is hidden.                                                        |\r\n| trigger         | string   | \"uiTourShow\"              | The DOM event used to show popup (see Angular UI Tooltip docs).

If the function returns\r\n a promise, it will wait until it is resolved before moving on.\r\n\r\n## Tour Steps\r\n\r\nTour steps are extensions of [Angular UI's Tooltips](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/#/tooltip) and therefore all\r\noptions are available. Although there are 3 types of Tooltips, there is only one type of Tour Step. In addition, almost\r\nall of the Tour options can be overridden by individual tour steps, as well as additional options that can be changed.\r\n\r\n### Additional Options\r\n\r\n|      Name        |   Type   | Default Value             |                     Description                                                                                                  |\r\n| --------------   | -------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| title            | string   | \"\"                        | The title of the popup                                                                                                           |\r\n| content          | string   | \"\"                        | The content of the popup. **Note:** can contain HTML for now, but this might change for security reasons.                        |\r\n| order            | number   | null                      | The order in which the step will be displayed. Although it is optional, the behavior is undefined if this is not explicitly set. |\r\n| fixed            | boolean  | false                     | Is the element fixed (does not discover automatically ATM).                                                                      |\r\n| preventScrolling | boolean  | false                     | Should page scrolling be prevented when popup is shown (I don't recommend using this, but there are times when it is useful).    |\r\n| nextStep         | string   | \"\"                        | If the next step is on a different page, set this to declare the name of the next step.                                          |\r\n| nextPath         | string   | \"\"                        | If the next step is on a different page, set this to the path of the next page.                                                  |\r\n| prevStep         | string   | \"\"                        | If the previous step is on a different page, set this to declare the name of the previous step.                                  |\r\n| prevPath         | string   | \"\"                        | If the previous step is on a different page, set this to the path of the previous page.                                          |\r\n| templateUrl      | string   | \"tour-step-template.html\" | Used as the template for the contents of the popup (see Angular UI Tooltip docs).                                                |\r\n\r\n**Best practice:** always set the order so that the steps display in the expected order. Steps with the same order will \r\ndisplay consecutively, but the order among them is unpredictable.\r\n\r\n## Directives\r\n\r\n### uiTour\r\n\r\nuiTour is the container for the tour steps; all tour steps must be declared as descendants of uiTour. \r\nThe declaration can be as simple as adding ui-tour to an element, or can include one or more options (shown above).\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n    <body ui-tour>\r\n        ... <!-- page content and tour steps -->\r\n    </body>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <div ui-tour ui-tour-on-start=\"onTourStart()\" ui-tour-placement=\"bottom\">\r\n        ... <!-- page content and tour steps -->\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n### tourStep\r\n\r\ntourSteps declare which elements should have a popup during the tour. They can be declared on any element, but some consideration\r\nshould be taken when deciding which element on which to declare them.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n    <body ui-tour>\r\n        <div id=\"mainMenu\" tour-step tour-step-title=\"Main Menu\" tour-step-content=\"Navigate the site using this menu.\" tour-step-order=\"0\" tour-step-placement=\"right\">...</div>\r\n        ...\r\n        <div id=\"settings\" tour-step tour-step-title=\"Settings\" tour-step-content=\"Click here to change your settings.\" tour-step-order=\"1\">...</div>\r\n        <div id=\"finalTourMessage\" tour-step tour-step-title=\"Welcome!\" tour-step-content=\"Enjoy using the app!\" tour-step-order=\"1000\" tour-step-orphan=\"true\" tour-step-backdrop=\"true\">...</div>\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <!-- fixed element -->\r\n    <body ui-tour>\r\n        <header style=\"position: fixed;\" tour-step tour-step-title=\"Header\" tour-step-content=\"This header is fixed at the top.\" tour-step-order=\"0\" tour-step-fixed=\"true\">...</header>\r\n    </body>\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    <!-- multi-page tour -->\r\n    <!-- layout -->\r\n    <body ui-tour>\r\n        <!-- page 1: included using ngView (/page1) -->\r\n        <div tour-step=\"page1step1\" ... tour-step-next-path=\"page2\" tour-step-next-step=\"page2step1\">...</div>\r\n        <!-- /page 1 -->\r\n        \r\n        <!-- page 2: ngView is populated when next step is requested after page1step1 -->\r\n        <div tour-step=\"page2step1\" ... tour-step-prev-path=\"page1\" tour-step-prev-step=\"page1step1\">...</div>\r\n    </body>\r\n\r\n## TODO's\r\n\r\n- Complete test suite. The config is tested, but the navigation and step coordination is not yet tested.\r\n- Implement currently missing features:\r\n  - Orphan steps\r\n  - TemplateUrl\r\n  - Scroll offset\r\n  - Trusted content\r\n  - Auto promise wrap for config events\r\n  - Configurable triggers\r\n  - More complete (and original) demo\r\n\r\n## Build It Yourself\r\n\r\nAssuming you have Node, grunt, and bower installed:\r\n\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n    bower install\r\n\r\n    grunt\r\n    \r\n## Demo\r\n    \r\nI have set up a simple demo using the Bootswatch Cerulean demo page (one of my favorite themes.) \r\nTo run the demo run `grunt demo connect:demo` and open http://localhost:8000 in the browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thanks and enjoy!**\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016  \r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[build-url]: https://travis-ci.org/benmarch/angular-ui-tour\r\n[build-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/benmarch/angular-ui-tour.png\r\n\r\n[gpa-url]: https://codeclimate.com/github/benmarch/angular-ui-tour\r\n[gpa-image]: https://codeclimate.com/github/benmarch/angular-ui-tour/badges/gpa.svg\r\n\r\n[coverage-url]: https://codeclimate.com/github/benmarch/angular-ui-tour/code?sort=covered_percent&sort_direction=desc\r\n[coverage-image]: https://codeclimate.com/github/benmarch/angular-ui-tour/coverage.png\r\n\r\n[depstat-url]: https://gemnasium.com/benmarch/angular-ui-tour\r\n[depstat-image]: https://gemnasium.com/benmarch/angular-ui-tour.svg\r\n\r\n[bower-url]: http://bower.io/search/?q=angular-ui-tour\r\n[bower-image]: https://badge.fury.io/bo/angular-ui-tour.png\r\n","google":"UA-74415657-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
